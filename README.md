## Abstract
<p>Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have seen dramatic improvements in performance over the past years, and such systems are now widely used for
security and commercial applications. An automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for a company to mark the attendance of their
employees. So Smart Attendance using Real Time Face Recognition is a real world
solution which comes with day to day activities of handling employees. The
task is very difficult as the real time background subtraction in an image is still
a challenge. To detect real time human face are used and a simple fast Principal
Component Analysis has used to recognize the faces detected with a high accuracy
rate. The matched face is used to mark attendance of the employee. Our system
maintains the attendance records of employees automatically. Manual entering of
in logbooks becomes a difficult task and it also wastes the time. So we designed
an efficient module that comprises of face recognition to manage the attendance
records of employees. Our module enrolls the staff’s face. This enrolling is a onetime process and their face will be stored in the database. During enrolling of face
we require a system since it is a onetime process. You can have your own roll number
as your employee id which will be unique for each employee. The presence of each
employee will be updated in a database. The results showed improved performance
over manual attendance management system. Attendance is marked after employee
identification. This product gives much more solutions with accurate results in user
interactive manner rather than existing attendance and leave management systems</p>

## Introduction
<p>Maintaining the attendance is very important in all the institutes for checking the
performance of employees. Every institute has its own method in this regard. Some
are taking attendance manually using the old paper or file based approach and some
have adopted methods of automatic attendance using some biometric techniques.
But in these methods employees have to wait for long time in making a queue at time
they enter the office. Many biometric systems are available but the key authentications are same is all the techniques. Every biometric system consists of enrolment
process in which unique features of a person is stored in the database and then
there are processes of identification and verification. These two processes compare
the biometric feature of a person with previously stored template captured at the
time of enrollment. Biometric templates can be of many types like Fingerprints,
Eye Iris, Face, Hand Geometry, Signature, Gait and voice. Our system uses the
face recognition approach for the automatic attendance of employees in the office
room environment without employees’ intervention . Face recognition consists of
two steps, in first step faces are detected in the image and then these detected faces
are compared with the database for verification. A number of methods have been
proposed for face detection i.e. Ada Boost algorithm, the Float Boost algorithm,
the S-Ada Boost algorithm Support Vector Machines (SVM), and the Bayes classifier. The efficiency of face recognition algorithm can be increased with the fast
face detection algorithm. In all the above methods SURF is most efficient. Our
system utilized this algorithm for the detection of faces in the office room image.
Face recognition techniques can be Divided into two types Appearance based which
use texture features that is applied to whole face or some specific Regions, other
is Feature based which uses geometric features like mouth, nose, eyes, eye brows,
cheeks and Relation between them. Statistical tools such as Linear Discriminate
Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel Methods, and Neural Networks, Eigen-faces have been used for construction of face templates.</p>
